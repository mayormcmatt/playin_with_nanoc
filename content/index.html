<h1>A Brand New nanoc Site</h1>

<p>I just generated this Nanoc site. Time to experiment with layouts and routing. Huzzah!</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Looks like this is straight-up HTML</strong> so I won't need to use Markdown syntax here</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Changing the layout</strong>, which is the “default.html” file in the “layouts” directory, shouldn't be too hard...I hope</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see how the sidebar works and whether or not I can use things like Foundation in this thing.</p>
